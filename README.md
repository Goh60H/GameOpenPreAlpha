## 🕹️ About the Game

The game features **turn-based combat and exploration** in a **procedurally generated dungeon** built on a hexagonal grid.

### Current Features
- Procedurally generated maps
- Turn-based combat
- Two enemy types
- Three playable dungeon levels

Each level currently:
- Shares the same visual ambientation
- Uses the same enemy types

### Level Transitions
- **Green over brown portal** → go to the next level  
- **Red over brown portal** → go to the previous level  

⚠️ **Note:**  
The first level contains a special exit portal, but its functionality has **not yet been implemented**.

### Death & Retry
Upon dying, the player may restart the game on a **newly generated map**, facing the same enemy types as before.

## ⚔️ Abilities

### 1. Jab
- Weak melee attack  
- Consumes **stamina**

### 2. Bow Shot
- Ranged attack  
- Cannot be used at melee range  
- Cannot pass through walls  
- Consumes **energy**  

⚠️ The character does not currently have a bow equipped, so the animation is incorrect.  
This ability is included so it can already be tested. The correct animation is the one used by the enemies wielding a bow.

### 3. Slash
- Strong melee attack  
- Consumes **stamina**

### 4. Teleport
- Instantly move to an unoccupied hexagon  
- Can cross walls  
- Consumes **energy**
